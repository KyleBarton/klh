Created "event" struct, instead of the clunkier "SessionInput", which
was always supposed to be a sort of placeholder anyway. Updated the
test client, and created a basic way to issue a command that's
basically an echo.

I also added a design image for documentation, see above.

I think from here it's best to drive the API from a plugin's
perspective. I think we should start with `Buffer` and `Diagnostics`,
which should be easy to get started and also both will be needed. The
Command issuance that I've included in this basic Event implementation
should be destined for the `Diagnostics` plugin, once that's
implemented.

Starting this will also force you to start thinking about listener
registration, authentication, & priority

I've added a core module called `plugin` which contains a plugin
registrar, a plugin listener type, and a plugin trait for
extensibility. It's probably time to try to incorporate it into
session & dispatch. Then I should create a diagnostics plugin to
verify that the whole thing works as expected. Code is getting pretty
messy (albeit still pretty modular), so a cleanup would probably be
warrented soon:
- Use Result and Option return types appropriately to handle errors
- Make sure Async is working through the system
- Generally, just make dispatch better? Idk, it's driving me a little
  crazy at the moment. This might get fixed as I address the above.
